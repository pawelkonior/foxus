## Inspiration
E-learning granted European and non-European students access to unprecedented learning opportunities. The global COVID-19 pandemic, however, turned e-learning from an opportunity to an urgent necessity. Advanced e-learning tools are therefore in high demand and are likely to remain so.

## What it does
*Foxus: Student focus monitoring system* provides teachers and students with a lightweight, simple, non-intrusive tool which uses machine learning techniques in order to monitor student focus and discreetly provide constructive feedback, ultimately helping make lectures more effective, more interesting, and less time consuming.

## How we built it
### Frontend
- React (allows for creation of a mobile app in the next step)	
- Material-UI Design (components tested for their utility and accessibility used by major IT companies like Google)
- Communication via Websockets (real-time data streaming technology for research)
- SVG animation for explaining our analytics data
### Backend
- Python Flask (microframework)
- Rest API & Websockets (technologies used for client-server communication)
- NoSQL database (MongoDB)
### Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms
- OpenCV (image recognition via Haar Cascade)
- Deep Neural Network with Convolutional Neural Network (user data classification)
- Neural network designed and pre-trained by the team
### DevOps
- Docker containerization
- managed by GKE (Kubernetes)
### Research solutions plan
- EEG (electroencephalography)
- fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest issue for us was designing the algorithm in a way as to correctly identify collections of key points needed for focus and emotion recognition.

## What we learned
We learned that things that may look simple on the surface may in fact be very multi-layered and time-consuming.

## What's next for Foqs: Student focus monitoring system
- clinical tests in order to optimize our model's parameters
- optimizing overall performance
- implementation of additional tracking functionalities like background disruption, voice analysis
- add-on / overlay in order for the software to work with all of the most popular video communicators on the market (e.g. Slack, Google Hangouts, Discord, Webex etc.)
- introduction of the software as not only education, but also business-oriented solution (team meetings, internal trainings)
